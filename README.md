👋 Hi, I’m Adam!

👀 I like video games, mechanical calculators, and hacking on personal software projects.

🌱 I’m currently learning my way around Kubernetes, [Zig](https://ziglang.org/), and [Serverless](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with you to help make development at Wanderu robust, easier, and more fun. [Nobody likes toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/).

📫 Find me on Slack as `@adam` or my non-work GitHub account: [`@komidore64`](https://github.com/komidore64).
